<h1>Brain Tumor Classification Using Deep Learning on Bangladeshi MRI Dataset</h1>

<section>
    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>
        This project focuses on classifying brain tumors from MRI images using deep
        learning and graph neural networks. A pretrained InceptionV3 model is used
        to extract high-level image features, which are further processed using an
        Enhanced Graph Neural Network for accurate tumor classification.
    </p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Overall Methodology</h2>
    <p>
        The following diagram illustrates the complete workflow of the proposed brain
        tumor classification system, starting from MRI image input to final tumor
        prediction using InceptionV3-based feature extraction, graph construction,
        and Enhanced GNN classification.

<section>
    <h2>1. Data Preparation</h2>
    <p>
        The brain MRI dataset is divided into three subsets to ensure reliable training
        and evaluation. The training set is used to learn model parameters, the validation
        set monitors performance during training, and the test set provides a final,
        unbiased assessment of model generalization.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Training set (65%) used for model learning</li>
        <li>Validation set (20%) used for performance monitoring</li>
        <li>Test set (15%) used for final evaluation on unseen data</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>2. Feature Extraction using InceptionV3</h2>
    <p>
        InceptionV3 is a deep convolutional neural network pretrained on the ImageNet
        dataset and is employed as a feature extractor. The final classification layer
        is removed, and each MRI image is transformed into a 2048-dimensional feature
        vector that captures discriminative visual characteristics.
    </p>

    <p>
        These extracted features encode critical information related to tumor shape,
        texture, and spatial structure, forming a compact numerical representation
        suitable for graph-based learning.
    </p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>3. Graph Construction</h2>
    <p>
        Each MRI image is represented as a node in a graph, with node attributes defined
        by the extracted deep features. Edges are constructed using a K-Nearest Neighbor
        (KNN) strategy to model similarity relationships between images, resulting in
        a structured graph representation.
    </p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>4. Enhanced Graph Neural Network (GNN)</h2>
    <p>
        The Enhanced Graph Neural Network is composed of multiple GCNConv layers that
        enable information exchange among neighboring nodes. The architecture integrates
        ReLU activation functions, batch normalization, and dropout layers to improve
        convergence stability and reduce overfitting.
    </p>

    <p>
        Global mean pooling is applied to aggregate node-level representations into
        a unified graph-level feature vector, which is subsequently passed to a fully
        connected layer for tumor classification.
    </p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>5. Training and Evaluation</h2>
    <p>
        Model training and evaluation are conducted using two core functions. The
        training function performs forward propagation, loss computation, and
        backpropagation, while the evaluation function assesses model performance
        on validation or test datasets without modifying model parameters.
    </p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>6. Hyperparameter Optimization with PSO</h2>
    <p>
        Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is utilized to automatically determine optimal
        hyperparameters for the GNN model. The optimization process explores various
        configurations, including hidden layer size, learning rate, dropout rate,
        and the number of graph convolution layers.
    </p>
    <p>
        Multiple inertia weight strategies-exponential decay, fractional decay, and
        triangular oscillation-are evaluated, with the best-performing configuration
        selected based on validation accuracy.
    </p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>7. Final Model Training</h2>
    <p>
        Using the optimized hyperparameters, the final Enhanced GNN model is trained
        with cosine annealing learning rate scheduling and early stopping mechanisms.
        These techniques ensure smooth convergence and prevent overfitting, while the
        best model is saved for later evaluation.
    </p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>8. Testing and Results</h2>
    <p>
        The optimized model is evaluated on an unseen test dataset. Performance is
        quantified using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix
        visualization to provide a comprehensive assessment of classification quality.
